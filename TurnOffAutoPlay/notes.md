# TurnOffAutoPlay extension

**Objective:** turn off Youtube "autoplay"

If you disable Youtube "autoplay" and clear your browser, the "autoplay" will
be enabled again. Same thing happens when you are in Incognito and that you go
to youtube.com

The extension will remedy the situation by disabling it for as long as you have
the extension installed. You can allow it to work in Incognito to have access
to this feature.

You will be able to go into Incognito and browse youtube.com without having
to disable the "autoplay" button.
